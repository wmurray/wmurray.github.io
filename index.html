        <h2>Howdy!</h2>
        <p>My name is William Murray, but you can call me Will. I am a budding web developer living in the Boston, Massachusetts area. I am currently employed as a computer technician. I love music and play 2 instruments (drums and guitar), enjoy riding my bicycle when the weather is warm, and try to carry my camera with me everywhere. I occasionally brew (and sample) beer, build computers, and sometimes you can find me on Steam or XBox Live.</p>

      <!--BEGIN: Education-->
      <section>
        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>I received my Bachelor of Fine Arts in Graphic Design from Emmanuel College in Boston, Massachusetts. My studies lasted from 2004 to 2008 when I received my degree. Areas of study included:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Charcoal Drawing</li>
          <li>Oil and Acrylic Painting</li>
          <li>Printmaking - Linoleum and Copper Etching</li>
          <li>Screen Printing</li>
          <li>Color Theory</li>
          <li>Design and Composition</li>
          <li>Advanced Graphic Design Theory</li>
          <li>Photography - Film and Digital</li>
          <li>Digital Video editing</li>
          <li>Web Design (HTML/CSS) and Flash</li>
        </ul>

        <p>After receiving my degree, I applied my skills to some freelance work in photography and design and began to self-teach HTML, CSS, JavaScript/jQuery, and a little bit of Ruby. I was always reading some tutorial site, book, or lesson from <a href="https://www.codeschool.com/">CodeSchool</a>.</p>
        <p>Recently I decided to further my education with a solid foundation, so I applied to a Front End Web Development program through <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/">General Assembly</a>. I am currently enrolled in the 12-week program which covers HTML and CSS, as well as diving into JavaScript, jQuery, and more. I look forward to completing this program in early February 2014 and perhaps continuing to study through General Assembly in the Back-End Web Development program.</p>

        <h2>Employment</h2>
        <h3>Apple 2008-Present</h3>
        <p>I have been working with Apple for the past 5(ish) years. I began in sales, where my repsonsibilities were as follows:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Assist customers in discovering their needs and provide relevant solutions.</li>
          <li>Learn on-the-fly about new products, workflows, and internal practices and procedures in order to educate customers and team members.</li>
          <li>Provide highest levels of customer service to every customer, regardless of the customer's reason for visiting.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>In less than one year's time, I was working as a technician. My first year, I performed troubleshooting and repairs on mobile devices, but in 2010 I was promoted and became Macintosh OS X and hardware certified. My responsibilities then included:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Troubleshoot and perform hardware and software repairs within tight deadlines.</li>
          <li>Work in a fast-paced, customer-focused environment to resolve issues on-the-spot.</li>
          <li>Develop strategies that increase productivity to exceed high customer expectations.</li>
          <li>Lead training to grow the team and onboard new members.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>RE/MAX Destiny</h3>
        <p>Before Apple, I worked at RE/MAX Destiny in Cambridge, Massachusetts as a Design Intern. It was a great opportunity for me to cut my teeth in the field:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Worked with customers to develop printed materials matching the given need.</li>
          <li>Developed templates for layouts to demonstrate products to customers.</li>
          <li>Worked with print companies to provide deliverables for customers.</li>
          <li>Prepared materials for print and web production.</li>
          <li>Worked in self-starting and self-taught environment that challenged and extended my skillset.</li>
        </ul>

        <!--BEGIN: Freelance-->
        <p>Lastly, I have produced freelance work. Most of this work has been distributed digitally via iTunes and other outlets:</p>
