        <h2>Howdy!</h2>
        <p>My name is William Murray, but you can call me Will. I am a budding web developer living in the Boston, Massachusetts area. I am currently employed as a computer technician. I love music and play 2 instruments (drums and guitar), enjoy riding my bicycle when the weather is warm, and try to carry my camera with me everywhere. I occasionally brew (and also sample) beer, build computers, and sometimes you can find me on Steam or XBox Live.</p>

        <h2>Work</h2>
        <p>Below are some examples of my web development projects. though they are functional, they are all subject to being updated/refactored/improved. This is not all of the work I have done, just a small smattering.</p>

Based on a dice game, the interface imitates a slot machine. It randomly generates three results (rolls 3 dice) and displays the results. Allows two players to use one browser window.

Given the HTML markup and CSS styles, the task was to complete the JavaScript document to make the game functional. The game reports win/loss/tie, and keeps score.

      <!--BEGIN: Education-->

        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>I received my Bachelor of Fine Arts in Graphic Design from Emmanuel College in Boston, Massachusetts. My studies lasted from 2004 to 2008 when I received my degree. Areas of study included:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Charcoal Drawing</li>
          <li>Oil and Acrylic Painting</li>
          <li>Printmaking - Linoleum and Copper Etching</li>
          <li>Screen Printing</li>
          <li>Color Theory</li>
          <li>Design and Composition</li>
          <li>Advanced Graphic Design Theory</li>
          <li>Photography - Film and Digital</li>
          <li>Digital Video editing</li>
          <li>Web Design (HTML/CSS) and Flash</li>
        </ul>

        <p>After receiving my degree, I applied my skills to some freelance work in photography and design and began to self-teach HTML, CSS, JavaScript/jQuery, and a little bit of Ruby. I was always reading some tutorial site, book, or lesson from <a href="https://www.codeschool.com/">CodeSchool</a>.</p>
        <p>Recently I decided to further my education with a solid foundation, so I applied to a Front End Web Development program through <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/">General Assembly</a>. I completed the 12-week program which covers HTML and CSS, as well as diving into JavaScript, jQuery, and more. I am continuing studies with a small group of friends from the course.</p>
