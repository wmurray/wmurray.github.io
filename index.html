        <h2>Howdy!</h2>
        <p>My name is William Murray, but you can call me Will. I am a budding web developer living in the Boston, Massachusetts area. I am currently employed as a computer technician. I love music and play 2 instruments (drums and guitar), enjoy riding my bicycle when the weather is warm, and try to carry my camera with me everywhere. I occasionally brew (and more than occasionally sample) beer, build computers, and sometimes you can find me on Steam or XBox Live.</p>

        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>I received my Bachelor of Fine Arts in Graphic Design from Emmanuel College in Boston, Massachusetts. My studies lasted from 2004 to 2008 when I received my degree. Areas of study included:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Charcoal Drawing</li>
          <li>Oil and Acrylic Painting</li>
          <li>Printmaking - Linoleum and Copper Etching</li>
          <li>Screen Printing</li>
          <li>Color Theory</li>
          <li>Design and Composition</li>
          <li>Advanced Graphic Design Theory</li>
          <li>Photography - Film and Digital</li>
          <li>Digital Video editing</li>
          <li>Web Design (HTML/CSS) and Flash</li>
        </ul>

        <p>After receiving my degree, I applied my skills to some freelance work in photography and design and began to self-teach HTML, CSS, JavaScript/jQuery, and a little bit of Ruby. I was always reading some tutorial site, book, or lesson from <a href="https://www.codeschool.com/">CodeSchool</a>.</p>
        <p>Recently I decided to further my education with a solid foundation, so I applied to a Front End Web Development program through <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/">General Assembly</a>. I completed the 12-week program which covers HTML and CSS, as well as diving into JavaScript, jQuery, and more. I am continuing studiea with a small group of friends from the course.</p>
