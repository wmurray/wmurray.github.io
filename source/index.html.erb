        <h2>Welcome!</h2>

        <p>You've found me! I am Will Murray, a Boston-based web developer.
        This is my portfolio and the blog of my endeavors. If you'd like to
        know more, stop by the <a href="/about.html">About</a> page.</p>

        <h2>What I Do</h2>

        <p>My passion is front end web development. I prefer using clean,
        semantic markup and styles combined with unobtrusive JavaScript to make a
        smooth and enjoyable experience. With a backround in design, I aim
        to consider the user first when crafting the front end solutions for
        your website design.</p>

        <p>My goal is to create clean, readable code that runs smoothly and
        efficiently, with the widest range of accessibility possible.</p>

        <h2>What I Use</h2>
